# Node-RED Workshop starter

Different ways to start a Node-RED instance, either locally, using MiniShift or using IBM Cloud.

**Before you begin**

Before setting up your environment, and in order to create the services needed for the workshop, you'll need an IBM Cloud account. 

1. [Sign up for an account here](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration)
2. Verify your account by clicking on the link in the email sent to you

## Run Node-RED using IBM Cloud

1. Log in to your [IBM Cloud account](http://cloud.ibm.com)
2. Click on "Catalog" towards the top-right corner
3. Select the "Software" tab
4. Search and select "Node-RED App" 
5. Following the tutorial steps at [developer.ibm.com](https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/how-to-create-a-node-red-starter-application/) for creating and deploying your Node-RED application.

** Note: ** make sure your application is assigned at least 256MB of runtime meory (the default will be 128MB, which is insufficient)

Once your app is deployed you'll be able to access it through the [resource list](https://cloud.ibm.com/resources)

## Run Node-RED using MiniShift

This requires having Minishift installed on your machine, if you don't you can follow a [detailed guide here](https://docs.okd.io/latest/minishift/index.html).

### Background information for Node in OpenShift

The OpenShift `nodejs` cartridge documentation can be found at:

http://openshift.github.io/documentation/oo_cartridge_guide.html#nodejs

### 1. Get Minishift running

Open your terminal and run the following commands: 
1. `minishift --vm-driver=hyperkit start` (or equivalent, based on which vm you're using)
2. `eval $(minishift oc-env)` 
3. `oc login -u developer`

### 2. Get OpenShift-Node-RED

**Clone the repository**

Still using your terminal:
1. Clone the [starter repo](https://github.com/emarilly/openshift-node-red) using the following command:
- `git clone https://github.com/emarilly/openshift-node-red`
2. Change directory into the OpenShift-noe-red folder
- `cd openshift-node-red`

**Update package.json**

Using your favorite IDE (we're not judging) open and edit the `package.json` file:
1. update the Node.js engine to [current LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (`>=10.0.0`)
2. update the NPM engine to be inline with node LTS (`>= 6.0.0`)
3. update Node-RED dependency to current levels (`>= 1.0`)
4. add a scripts section
  ```
  "scripts": {
    "build": "true",
    "start": "node server.js"
  },
  ```

**Update server.js**

Next, open and edit the `server.js` file:
1. comment out basic authentication setup
  ```
  //setup basic authentication
  //var basicAuth = require('basic-auth-connect');
  //self.app.use(basicAuth(function(user, pass) {
  //    return user === 'test' && pass === atob('dGVzdA==');
  //}));
  ```
2. update local port to `8080`
  ```
  self.port      = process.env.OPENSHIFT_NODEJS_PORT || 8080;
  ```
3. update default ipaddress to "0.0.0.0"
  ```
  self.ipaddress = process.env.OPENSHIFT_NODEJS_IP || "0.0.0.0";
  ```

Once this is all done, go back to your terminal and run the following command `npm install`.

### Push Node-RED on Minishift

1. Create a new app and give it a name (ie. myfirst-node-red)
- `oc new-app nodejs~./ --name=myfirst-node-red`
2. Start the build of your app 
- `oc start-build myfirst-node-red --from-dir=./`
3. You can check the status at any time using
- run `oc status` 
4. Once the build is complete, run the following command to get the service
- `oc get service myfirst-node-red`
5. Expose the service at a host name using:
- `oc expose service myfirst-node-red`

All done! You can now access your Node-RED application running on Minishift using the response from `oc get route/myfirst-node-red`

```
NAME               HOST/PORT                                        PATH      SERVICES           PORT       TERMINATION   WILDCARD
myfirst-node-red   myfirst-node-red-node-red.<aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd>.nip.io             myfirst-node-red   8080-tcp                 None
```
6. Open your browser to ```http://myfirst-node-red-node-red.<aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd>.nip.io```

## Run Node-RED locally

Follow the instructions on the [Node-RED website](https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/local)


You're all set and ready to go! Go back to the workshop page and follow the instructions there.



## Troubleshooting

1. When building your app to run on Minishift the build may fail on the first go, try running the following command again `oc start-build myfirst-node-red --from-dir=./`
